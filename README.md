## Part1 The Lexer
### [Steps] The build and execution for my lexer

flex lexer.l

gcc lex.yy.c

(You can then test the example by typing from the keyboard.)

It defines various patterns to match and associated actions to take when a match is found. The patterns include keywords such as "START," "MAIN," and "END," as well as identifiers, integers, strings, semicolons, and line terminators.

When a match is found, the corresponding action is taken. For example, if a keyword is matched, the text "is a valid KEYWORD" is printed to the console. If a string is matched, the text "is a STRING" is printed, and so on.

The function printCapacity is called when a pattern matching a declaration is found. This function takes two arguments: a string indicating the type of declaration ("Declaration"), and a string containing the matched text. It calculates the length of the matched text and prints a message indicating the maximum number of digits that can be held in the corresponding variable.

The program also includes some general configuration options for the Lex compiler, such as ignoring whitespace and making the matching case-insensitive. Finally, it includes a main function that calls the yylex function, which is automatically generated by Lex and performs the actual pattern matching and action execution.
